abstract = {Heterogeneous finite-difference (FD) modeling assumes that the boundary conditions of the elastic wavefield between material discontinuities are implicitly fulfilled by the distribution of the elastic parameters on the numerical grid. It is widely applied to weak elastic contrasts between geologic formations inside the earth. We test the accuracy at the free surface of the earth. The accuracy for modeling Rayleigh waves using the conventional standard staggered-grid (SSG) and the rotated staggered grid (RSG) is investigated. The accuracy tests reveal that one cannot rely on conventional numerical dispersion discretization criteria. A higher sampling is necessary to obtain acceptable accuracy. In the case of planar free surfaces aligned with the grid, 15 to 30 grid points per minimum wavelength of the Rayleigh wave are required. The widely used explicit boundary condition, the so-called image method, produces similar accuracy and requires approximately half the sampling of the wavefield compared to heterogeneous free-surface modeling. For a free-surface not aligned with the grid (surface topography), the error increases significantly and varies with the dip angle of the interface. For an irregular interface, the RSG scheme is more accurate than the SSG scheme. The RSG scheme, however, requires 60 grid points per minimum wavelength to achieve good accuracy for all dip angles. The high computation requirements for 3D simulations on such fine grids limit the application of heterogenous modeling in the presence of complex surface topography.},

abstract = {The problem of interpretation of seismic reflection data can be posed with sufficient generality using the concepts of inverse theory. In its roughest formulation, the inverse problem consists of obtaining the Earth model for which the predicted data best fit the observed data. If an adequate forward model is used, this best model will give the best images of the Earth's interior.Three parameters are needed for describing a perfectly elastic, isotropic, Earth: the density rho (x) and the Lame parameters lambda (x) and mu (x), or the density rho (x) and the P-wave and S-wave velocities alpha (x) and beta (x). The choice of parameters is not neutral, in the sense that although theoretically equivalent, if they are not adequately chosen the numerical algorithms in the inversion can be inefficient. In the long (spatial) wavelengths of the model, adequate parameters are the P-wave and S-wave velocities, while in the short (spatial) wavelengths, P-wave impedance, S-wave impedance, and density are adequate. The problem of inversion of waveforms is highly nonlinear for the long wavelengths of the velocities, while it is reasonably linear for the short wavelengths of the impedances and density. Furthermore, this parameterization defines a highly hierarchical problem: the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance are much more important parameters than their counterparts for S-waves (in terms of interpreting observed amplitudes), and the latter are much more important than the density. This suggests solving the general inverse problem (which must involve all the parameters) by first optimizing for the P-wave velocity and impedance, then optimizing for the S-wave velocity and impedance, and finally optimizing for density.The first part of the problem of obtaining the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and the short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance is similar to the problem solved by present industrial practice (for accurate data interpretation through velocity analysis and 'prestack migration'). In fact, the method proposed here produces (as a byproduct) a generalization to the elastic case of the equations of 'prestack acoustic migration.'Once an adequate model of the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and of the short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance has been obtained, the data residuals should essentially contain information on S-waves (essentially P-S and S-P converted waves). Once the corresponding model of S-wave velocity (long wavelengths) and S-wave impedance (short wavelengths) has been obtained, and if the remaining residuals still contain information, an optimization for density should be performed (the short wavelengths of impedances do not give independent information on density and velocity independently).Because the problem is nonlinear, the whole process should be iterated to convergence; however, the information from each parameter should be independent enough for an interesting first solution.},

Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.},

abstract = {One of the nagging problems which arises in application of discrete solution methods for wave‐propagation calculations is the presence of reflections or wraparound from the boundaries of the numerical mesh. These undesired events eventually override the actual seismic signals which propagate in the modeled region. The solution to avoiding boundary effects used to be to enlarge the numerical mesh, thus delaying the side reflections and wraparound longer than the range of times involved in the modeling. Obviously this solution considerably increases the expense of computation. More recently, nonreflecting boundary conditions were introduced for the finite‐difference method (Clayton and Enquist, 1977; Reynolds, 1978). These boundary conditions are based on replacing the wave equation in the boundary region by one‐way wave equations which do not permit energy to propagate from the boundaries into the numerical mesh. This approach has been relatively successful, except that its effectiveness degrades for events which impinge on the boundaries at shallow angles. It is also not clear how to apply this type of boundary condition to global discrete methods such as the Fourier method for which all grid points are coupled.},

abstract = {We draw connections between seismic tomography, adjoint methods popular in climate and ocean dynamics, time-reversal imaging and finite-frequency ‘banana-doughnut' kernels. We demonstrate that Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives for tomographic and (finite) source inversions may be obtained based upon just two numerical simulations for each earthquake: one calculation for the current model and a second, ‘adjoint', calculation that uses time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous, fictitious sources. For a given model, m, we consider objective functions $\chi$(m) that minimize differences between waveforms, traveltimes or amplitudes. For tomographic inversions we show that the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of such objective functions may be written in the generic form , where $\delta$ ln m=$\delta$m/m denotes the relative model perturbation. The volumetric kernel Km is defined throughout the model volume V and is determined by time-integrated products between spatial and temporal derivatives of the regular displacement field s and the adjoint displacement field s†; the latter is obtained by using time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous sources. In waveform tomography the time-reversed signal consists of differences between the data and the synthetics, in traveltime tomography it is determined by synthetic velocities, and in amplitude tomography it is controlled by synthetic displacements. For each event, the construction of the kernel Km requires one forward calculation for the regular field s and one adjoint calculation involving the fields s and s†. In the case of traveltime tomography, the kernels Km are weighted combinations of banana-doughnut kernels. For multiple events the kernels are simply summed. The final summed kernel is controlled by the distribution of events and stations. Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of the objective function with respect to topographic variations $\delta$h on internal discontinuities may be expressed in terms of 2-D kernels Kh and Kh in the form , where $\Sigma$ denotes a solid-solid or fluid-solid boundary and $\Sigma$FS a fluid–solid boundary, and ∇$\Sigma$ denotes the surface gradient. We illustrate how amplitude anomalies may be inverted for lateral variations in elastic and anelastic structure. In the context of a finite-source inversion, the model vector consists of the time-dependent elements of the moment-density tensor m(x, t). We demonstrate that the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of the objective function $\chi$ may in this case be written in the form , where $\epsilon$† denotes the adjoint strain tensor on the finite-fault plane $\Sigma$. In the case of a point source this result reduces further to the calculation of the time-dependent adjoint strain tensor $\epsilon$† at the location of the point source, an approach reminiscent of an acoustic time-reversal mirror. The theory is illustrated for both tomographic and source inversions using a 2-D spectral-element method.},

abstract = {The modelling of elastic waves in fractured media with an explicit finite-difference scheme causes instability problems on a staggered grid when the medium possesses high-contrast discontinuities (strong heterogeneities). For the present study we apply the rotated staggered grid. Using this modified grid it is possible to simulate the propagation of elastic waves in a 2D or 3D medium containing cracks, pores or free surfaces without hard-coded boundary conditions. Therefore it allows an efficient and precise numerical study of effective velocities in fractured structures. We model the propagation of plane waves through a set of different, randomly cracked media. In these numerical experiments we vary the wavelength of the plane waves, the crack porosity and the crack density. The synthetic results are compared with several static theories that predict the effective P- and S-wave velocities in fractured materials in the long wavelength limit. For randomly distributed and randomly orientated, rectilinear, non-intersecting, thin, dry cracks, the numerical simulations of velocities of P-, SV- and SH-waves are in excellent agreement with the results of the modified (or differential) self-consistent theory. On the other hand for intersecting cracks, the critical crack-density (porosity) concept must be taken into account. To describe the wave velocities in media with intersecting cracks, we propose introducing the critical crack-density concept into the modified self-consistent theory. Numerical simulations show that this new formulation predicts effective elastic properties accurately for such a case.},

We demonstrate how to improve the PML at grazing incidence for the differential seismic wave equation based on an unsplit convolution technique.

abstract = {Building high-resolution models of several physical properties of the subsurface by multiparameter full waveform inversion (FWI) of multicomponent data will be a challenge for seismic imaging for the next decade. The physical properties, which govern propagation of seismic waves in visco-elastic media, are the velocities of the P-and S-waves, density, attenuation, and anisotropic parameters. Updating each property is challenging because several parameters of a different nature can have a coupled effect on the seismic response for a particular propagation regime (from transmission to reflection). This is generally referred to as trade-off or crosstalk between parameters. Moreover, different parameter classes can have different orders of magnitude or physical units and footprints of different strength in the wavefield, which can make the inversion poorly conditioned if it is not properly scaled. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {The nonlinear problem of inversion of seismic waveforms can be set up using least-squares methods. The inverse problem is then reduced to the problem of minimizing a lp;nonquadratic) function in a space of many (104 to 106) variables. Using gradient methods leads to iterative algorithms, each iteration implying a forward propagation generated by the actual sources, a backward propagation generated by the data residuals (acting as if they were sources), and a correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained, which gives the updated model. The quality of the results of any inverse method depends heavily on the realism of the forward modeling. Finite-difference schemes are a good choice relative to realism because, although they are time-consuming, they give excellent results. Numerical tests performed with multioffset synthetic data from a two-dimensional model prove the feasibility of the approach. If only surface-recorded reflections are used, the high spatial frequency content of the model (but not the low spatial frequencies) is recovered in few ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}=5) iterations. By using transmitted data also (e.g., between two boreholes), all the spatial frequencies are recovered. Since the problem is nonlinear, if the initial guess is far enough from the true solution, the iterative algorithm may converge into a secondary solution. A nonlinear inversion with 8 shots, each shot recorded at 400 receiver locations, with 700 samples in each seismogram, corresponding to a {\{}2-D{\}} model described by 40 000 grid points, takes approximately 1 hour in a {\{}CRAY{\}} {\{}1S{\}} supercomputer.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}In the context of the simulation of wave propagation, the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary layer has proven to be efficient to absorb non-grazing incidence waves. However, the classical discrete PML cannot efficiently absorb waves reaching the absorbing layer at grazing incidence. This is observed, for instance, in the case of thin mesh slices, or in the case of sources located close to the absorbing boundaries or receivers located at large offset. In order to improve the PML efficiency at grazing incidence we derive an unsplit convolutional PML (CPML) for a fourth-order staggered finite-difference numerical scheme applied to the 3-D viscoelastic seismic wave equation. The time marching equations of the standard linear solid mechanisms used do not need to be split and only the memory variables associated with velocity derivatives are stored at each time step. This is important in the case of more than one damping mechanism. Memory storage is reduced by more than 70 per cent in the PML regions in 3-D simulations compared to split PMLs optimized at grazing incidence. We validate the technique based on a benchmark performed in a thin mesh slice.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Finite-difference solutions to the wave equation are pervasive in the modeling of seismic wave propagation (Kelly and Marfurt, 1990) and in seismic imaging (Bording and Lines, 1997). That is, they are useful for the forward problem (modeling) and the inverse problem (migration). In computational solutions to the wave equation, it is necessary to be aware of conditions for numerical stability. In this short note, we examine a convenient recipe for insuring stability in our finite-difference solutions to the wave equation. The stability analysis for finite-difference solutions of partial differential equations is handled using a method originally developed by Von Neumann and described by Press et al. (1986, p. 827-830). DERIVATION OF A RECIPE FOR STABILITY For our discussions, we consider the wave equation for a homogeneous acoustic medium, which in 3-D is given by: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 t u v z u y u x u ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ + ∂ ∂ + ∂ ∂ (1) where) , , , (t z y x u is the pressure wavefield as a function of space and time and v is the acoustic velocity. Finite-difference computations require determinations of spatial and temporal sampling criteria. As pointed out by Kelly and Marfurt (1990), Mufti (1990) and others, spatial sampling is generally chosen to avoid grid dispersion in solutions. Then, having chosen spatial sampling, the temporal sampling is chosen to avoid numerical instability. Recent papers by Mufti (1990) and Wu et al. (1996) derived stability criteria for three-dimensional finite-difference solutions to the wave equations for second order and fourth order systems. While these papers are correct, there is apparently a general recipe for a stability criterion which is generally applicable for arbitrary orders of accuracy and spatial dimensions. For the moment, we will facetiously call this condition " Bording's conjecture " . The criterion states that for a grid size of h , a time sampling interval of ∆t , a seismic velocity of v , the stability formula for finite-difference computation is given by: 2 1 a a h t v ≤ ∆ (2a)},

@article{Plessix2006,
abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Frchet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Frchet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved. Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.},

Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 European Association of Geoscientists {\&} Engineers. The previous finite-difference numerical schemes designed for direct application to second-order elastic wave equations in terms of displacement components are strongly dependent on Poisson's ratio. This fact makes theses schemes useless for modelling in offshore regions or even in onshore regions where there is a high Poisson's ratio material. As is well known, the use of staggered-grid formulations solves this drawback. The most common staggered-grid algorithms apply central-difference operators to the first-order velocity-stress wave equations. They have been one of the most successfully applied numerical algorithms for seismic modelling, although these schemes require more computational memory than those mentioned based on second-order wave equations. The goal of the present paper is to develop a general theory that enables one to formulate equivalent staggered-grid schemes for direct application to hyperbolic second-order wave equations. All the theory necessary to formulate these schemes is presented in detail, including issues regarding source application, providing a general method to construct staggered-grid formulations to a wide range of cases. Afterwards, the equivalent staggered-grid theory is applied to anisotropic elastic wave equations in terms of only velocity components (or similar displacements) for two important cases: general anisotropic media and vertical transverse isotropy media using, respectively, the rotated and the standard staggered-grid configurations. For sake of simplicity, we present the schemes in terms of velocities in the second- and fourth-order spatial approximations, with second-order approximation in time for 2D media. However, the theory developed is general and can be applied to any set of second-order equations (in terms of only displacement, velocity, or even stress components), using any staggered-grid configuration with any spatial approximation order in 2D or 3D cases. Some of these equivalent staggered-grid schemes require less computer memory than the corresponding standard staggered-grid formulation, although the programming is more evolved. As will be shown in theory and practice, with numerical examples, the equivalent staggered-grid schemes produce results equivalent to corresponding standard staggered-grid schemes with computational advantages. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the equivalent staggered-grid theory is general and can be applied to other modelling contexts, e.g., in electrodynamical and poroelastic wave propagation problems in a systematic and simple way.},

abstract = {Several 3D seismic acoustic full-waveform inversions (FWIs) of offshore data sets have been reported over the last five years. A successful updating of the long-to-intermediate wavelengths of the earth model by FWI requires good-quality wide-angle, long- offset, low-frequency data. Recent improvements in acquisition make such data sets available on land, too. We evaluated a 3D application on a data set recorded in North Oman. The data contain low frequencies down to 1.5 Hz, long-offsets, and wide azimuths. The application of acoustic FWI on land remains com- plicated because of the elastic effects, notably the strong ground- roll and many acquisition and human-activity-related noises. The presence of fast carbonate layers in this region induces velocity inversions, difficult to recover from diving or postcritical waves. We accounted for anisotropic effects as we include FWI in a classical structural imaging workflow.With a dedicated process- ing of the data and a simultaneous inversion of theNMO velocity and the anelliptic-anisotropic parameter, we succeeded to inter- pret the kinematics of transmitted and reflected waves, although in the waveform inversion we included only the diving and post- critical waves. This approach has some limitations because of the acoustic assumption. We could not obtain a high-resolution image, especially at the shale-carbonate interfaces. There is also a trade-off between theNMOvelocity and the anelliptic anisotropic parameter. However, the image improvements after acoustic FWI and the ability to handle the large data volume make this tech- nique attractive in an imaging workflow. INTRODUCTION},

The principal idea of this method con-sists of introducing an absorbing layer in which we decompose each component of the unknown into two auxiliary components: a component orthogonal to the boundary and a component parallel to it. A system of equations governing these new unknowns then is con-structed. A damping term finally is introduced for the component orthogonal to the boundary. This layer model has the property of generating no reflection at the inter-face between the free medium and the artificial absorb-ing medium. In practice, both the boundary condition introduced at the outer boundary of the layer and the dis-persion resulting from the numerical scheme produce a small reflection which can be controlled even with very thin layers. As we will show with several experiments, this model gives very satisfactory results; namely, the re-flection coefficient, even in the case of heterogeneous, anisotropic media, is about 1{\%} for a layer thickness of five space discretization steps.},

abstract = {A compilation of compressional-wave (Vp) and shear-wave (Vs) velocities and densities for a wide variety of common lithologies is used to define new nonlinear, multivalued, and quantitative relations between these properties for the Earth's crust. Wireline borehole logs, vertical seismic profiles, laboratory measurements, and seismic tomography models provide a diverse dataset for deriving empirical relations between crustal Vp and Vs. The proposed Vs as a function of Vp relations fit Vs and Vp borehole logs in Quaternary alluvium and Salinian granites as well as laboratory measurements over a 7-km/sec-wide range in Vp. The relations derived here are very close to those used to develop a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970 data, and thus provide support for that model. These data, and these relations, show a rapid increase in Vs as Vp increases to 3.5 km/sec leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits than commonly assumed. These relations, appropriate for active continental margins where earthquakes are prone to occur, suggests that amplification of strong ground motions by shallow geologic deposits may not be as large as predicted by some earlier models.},

abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging data-fitting procedure based on full-wavefield modeling to extract quantitative information from seismograms. High-resolution imaging at half the propagated wavelength is expected. Recent advances in high-performance computing and multifold/multicomponent wide-aperture and wide-azimuth acquisitions make 3D acoustic FWI feasible today. Key ingredients of FWI are an efficient forward-modeling engine and a local differential approach, in which the gradient and the Hessian operators are efficiently estimated. Local optimization does not, however, prevent convergence of the misfit function toward local minima because of the limited accuracy of the starting model, the lack of low frequencies, the presence of noise, and the approximate modeling of thewave-physics complexity. Different hierarchical multiscale strategies are designed to mitigate the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of FWI by incorporating progressively shorter wavelengths in the parameter space. Synthetic and real-data case studies address reconstructing various parameters, from V P and V S velocities to density, anisotropy, and attenuation. This review attempts to illuminate the state of the art of FWI. Crucial jumps, however, remain necessary to make it as popular as migration techniques. The challenges can be categorized as (1) building accurate starting models with automatic procedures and/or recording low frequencies, (2) defining new minimization criteria to mitigate the sensitivity of FWI to amplitude errors and increasing the robustness of FWI when multiple parameter classes are estimated, and (3) improving computational efficiency by data-compression techniques to make 3D elastic FWI feasible.

abstract = {Rayleigh waves are generated along the free surface and their propagation can be strongly influenced by surface topography. Modeling of Rayleigh waves in the near surface in the presence of topography is fundamental to the study of surface waves in environmental and engineering geophysics. For simulation of Rayleigh waves, the traction-free boundary condition needs to be satisfied on the free surface. A vacuum formulation naturally incorporates surface topography in finite-difference (FD) modeling by treating the surface grid nodes as the internal grid nodes. However, the conventional vacuum formulation does not completely fulfill the free-surface boundary condition and becomes unstable for modeling using high-order FD operators. We developed a stable vacuum formulation that fully satisfies the free-surface boundary condition by choosing an appropriate combination of the staggered-grid form and a parameter-averaging scheme. The elastic parameters on the topographic free surface are updated with exactly the same treatment as internal grid nodes. The improved vacuum formulation can accurately and stably simulate Rayleigh waves along the topographic surface for homogeneous and heterogeneous elastic models with high Poisson's ratios ({\textgreater} 0.4). This method requires fewer grid points per wavelength than the stress-image-based methods. Internal discontinuities in a model can be handled without modification of the algorithm. Only minor changes are required to implement the improved vacuum formulation in existing 2D FD modeling codes.},

@article{Castellanos2015,
abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) of 3-D data sets has recently been possible thanks to the development of high performance computing. However, FWI remains a computationally intensive task when high frequencies are injected in the inversion or more complex wave physics (viscoelastic) is accounted for. The highest computational cost results from the numerical solution of the wave equation for each seismic source. To reduce the computational burden, one well-known technique is to employ a random linear combination of the sources, rather that using each source independently. This technique, known as source encoding, has shown to successfully reduce the computational cost when applied to real data. Up to now, the inversion is normally carried out using gradient descent algorithms. With the idea of achieving a fast and robust frequency-domain FWI, we assess the performance of the random source encoding method when it is interfaced with second-order optimization methods (quasi-Newton l-BFGS, truncated Newton). Because of the additional seismic modelings required to compute the Newton descent direction, it is not clear beforehand if truncated Newton methods can indeed further reduce the computational cost compared to gradient algorithms. We design precise stopping criteria of iterations to fairly assess the computational cost and the speed-up provided by the source encoding method for each optimization method. We perform experiment on synthetic and real data sets. In both cases, we confirm that combining source encoding with second-order optimization methods reduces the computational cost compared to the case where source encoding is interfaced with gradient descent algorithms. For the synthetic data set, inspired from the geology of Gulf of Mexico, we show that the quasi-Newton l-BFGS algorithm requires the lowest computational cost. For the real data set application on the Valhall data, we show that the truncated Newton methods provide the most robust direction of descent.},

A differential equation of the elastic wave in isotropic and heterogeneous media is solved using a finite difference method with staggered mesh with second order accuracy in time and fourth grade in space, aiming for greater stability and efficiency. The solution of the equation was implemented in C. Scons was used for compiling the programs and Madagascar (seismic data processing software) to control the flow of data and perform seismic simulation. The testbed was the GUANE-1 architecture. OpenMP was used to accelerate the application, running the algorithm on 24 CPUs on one node. CUDA was used to run the solution in a hybrid architecture with CPU and GPU, using only global memory on the graphic processors. Finally an analysis and comparison of metrics and runtime acceleration of the two models of parallelization is used to check the processing power that can be achieved with hybrid architectures.},

abstract = {In this work, a method is presented to extend the convolutional perfectly matched layer (C-PML) to simulate acoustic wave propagation in elastic media with a second-order equation formulation. This non-physical layer is used at the computational edge of a finite element method algorithm in frequency domain, and a pseudo-spectral algorithm in time domain, as an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to truncate unbounded media. Numerical results show that the C-PML ABC attenuates the outgoing surface waves more effectively than classical PML ABC as proposed by Berenger [J. Comput. Phys. 114, 195-200 (1994)] for electromagnetic waves in the case of oblique incidence, where the PML method suffers from large spurious reflections. Moreover, a modification of the proposed C-PML formulation is also discussed in order to stabilize the absorbing layer in anisotropic solids where numerical instabilities can appear.},
