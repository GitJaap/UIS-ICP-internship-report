abstract = {Building high-resolution models of several physical properties of the subsurface by multiparameter full waveform inversion (FWI) of multicomponent data will be a challenge for seismic imaging for the next decade. The physical properties, which govern propagation of seismic waves in visco-elastic media, are the velocities of the P-and S-waves, density, attenuation, and anisotropic parameters. Updating each property is challenging because several parameters of a different nature can have a coupled effect on the seismic response for a particular propagation regime (from transmission to reflection). This is generally referred to as trade-off or crosstalk between parameters. Moreover, different parameter classes can have different orders of magnitude or physical units and footprints of different strength in the wavefield, which can make the inversion poorly conditioned if it is not properly scaled. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Several 3D seismic acoustic full-waveform inversions (FWIs) of offshore data sets have been reported over the last five years. A successful updating of the long-to-intermediate wavelengths of the earth model by FWI requires good-quality wide-angle, long- offset, low-frequency data. Recent improvements in acquisition make such data sets available on land, too. We evaluated a 3D application on a data set recorded in North Oman. The data contain low frequencies down to 1.5 Hz, long-offsets, and wide azimuths. The application of acoustic FWI on land remains com- plicated because of the elastic effects, notably the strong ground- roll and many acquisition and human-activity-related noises. The presence of fast carbonate layers in this region induces velocity inversions, difficult to recover from diving or postcritical waves. We accounted for anisotropic effects as we include FWI in a classical structural imaging workflow.With a dedicated process- ing of the data and a simultaneous inversion of theNMO velocity and the anelliptic-anisotropic parameter, we succeeded to inter- pret the kinematics of transmitted and reflected waves, although in the waveform inversion we included only the diving and post- critical waves. This approach has some limitations because of the acoustic assumption. We could not obtain a high-resolution image, especially at the shale-carbonate interfaces. There is also a trade-off between theNMOvelocity and the anelliptic anisotropic parameter. However, the image improvements after acoustic FWI and the ability to handle the large data volume make this tech- nique attractive in an imaging workflow. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {We draw connections between seismic tomography, adjoint methods popular in climate and ocean dynamics, time-reversal imaging and finite-frequency ‘banana-doughnut' kernels. We demonstrate that Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives for tomographic and (finite) source inversions may be obtained based upon just two numerical simulations for each earthquake: one calculation for the current model and a second, ‘adjoint', calculation that uses time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous, fictitious sources. For a given model, m, we consider objective functions $\chi$(m) that minimize differences between waveforms, traveltimes or amplitudes. For tomographic inversions we show that the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of such objective functions may be written in the generic form , where $\delta$ ln m=$\delta$m/m denotes the relative model perturbation. The volumetric kernel Km is defined throughout the model volume V and is determined by time-integrated products between spatial and temporal derivatives of the regular displacement field s and the adjoint displacement field s†; the latter is obtained by using time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous sources. In waveform tomography the time-reversed signal consists of differences between the data and the synthetics, in traveltime tomography it is determined by synthetic velocities, and in amplitude tomography it is controlled by synthetic displacements. For each event, the construction of the kernel Km requires one forward calculation for the regular field s and one adjoint calculation involving the fields s and s†. In the case of traveltime tomography, the kernels Km are weighted combinations of banana-doughnut kernels. For multiple events the kernels are simply summed. The final summed kernel is controlled by the distribution of events and stations. Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of the objective function with respect to topographic variations $\delta$h on internal discontinuities may be expressed in terms of 2-D kernels Kh and Kh in the form , where $\Sigma$ denotes a solid-solid or fluid-solid boundary and $\Sigma$FS a fluid–solid boundary, and ∇$\Sigma$ denotes the surface gradient. We illustrate how amplitude anomalies may be inverted for lateral variations in elastic and anelastic structure. In the context of a finite-source inversion, the model vector consists of the time-dependent elements of the moment-density tensor m(x, t). We demonstrate that the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivatives of the objective function $\chi$ may in this case be written in the form , where $\epsilon$† denotes the adjoint strain tensor on the finite-fault plane $\Sigma$. In the case of a point source this result reduces further to the calculation of the time-dependent adjoint strain tensor $\epsilon$† at the location of the point source, an approach reminiscent of an acoustic time-reversal mirror. The theory is illustrated for both tomographic and source inversions using a 2-D spectral-element method.},

@article{Plessix2006,
abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Frchet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Frchet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved. Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.},

abstract = {The problem of interpretation of seismic reflection data can be posed with sufficient generality using the concepts of inverse theory. In its roughest formulation, the inverse problem consists of obtaining the Earth model for which the predicted data best fit the observed data. If an adequate forward model is used, this best model will give the best images of the Earth's interior.Three parameters are needed for describing a perfectly elastic, isotropic, Earth: the density rho (x) and the Lame parameters lambda (x) and mu (x), or the density rho (x) and the P-wave and S-wave velocities alpha (x) and beta (x). The choice of parameters is not neutral, in the sense that although theoretically equivalent, if they are not adequately chosen the numerical algorithms in the inversion can be inefficient. In the long (spatial) wavelengths of the model, adequate parameters are the P-wave and S-wave velocities, while in the short (spatial) wavelengths, P-wave impedance, S-wave impedance, and density are adequate. The problem of inversion of waveforms is highly nonlinear for the long wavelengths of the velocities, while it is reasonably linear for the short wavelengths of the impedances and density. Furthermore, this parameterization defines a highly hierarchical problem: the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance are much more important parameters than their counterparts for S-waves (in terms of interpreting observed amplitudes), and the latter are much more important than the density. This suggests solving the general inverse problem (which must involve all the parameters) by first optimizing for the P-wave velocity and impedance, then optimizing for the S-wave velocity and impedance, and finally optimizing for density.The first part of the problem of obtaining the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and the short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance is similar to the problem solved by present industrial practice (for accurate data interpretation through velocity analysis and 'prestack migration'). In fact, the method proposed here produces (as a byproduct) a generalization to the elastic case of the equations of 'prestack acoustic migration.'Once an adequate model of the long wavelengths of the P-wave velocity and of the short wavelengths of the P-wave impedance has been obtained, the data residuals should essentially contain information on S-waves (essentially P-S and S-P converted waves). Once the corresponding model of S-wave velocity (long wavelengths) and S-wave impedance (short wavelengths) has been obtained, and if the remaining residuals still contain information, an optimization for density should be performed (the short wavelengths of impedances do not give independent information on density and velocity independently).Because the problem is nonlinear, the whole process should be iterated to convergence; however, the information from each parameter should be independent enough for an interesting first solution.},

abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful method for reconstructing subsurface parameters from local measurements of the seismic wavefield. This method consists in minimizing the distance between predicted and recorded data. The predicted data are computed as the solution of a wave-propagation problem. Conventional numerical methods for the resolution of FWI problems are gradient-based methods, such as the preconditioned steepest descent, or more recently the {\$}l{\$}-BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm. In this study, we investigate the desirability of applying a truncated Newton method to FWI. The inverse Hessian operator plays a crucial role in the parameter reconstruction. The truncated Newton method allows one to better account for this operator. This method is based on the computation of the Newton descent direction by solving the corresponding linear system through an iterative procedure such as the conjugate gradient method. The large-scale nature of FWI problems requires us, however, to carefully implement ...},
