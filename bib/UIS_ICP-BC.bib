abstract = {We present and analyze a perfectly matched, absorb-ing layer model for the velocity-stress formulation of elastodynamics. The principal idea of this method con-sists of introducing an absorbing layer in which we decompose each component of the unknown into two auxiliary components: a component orthogonal to the boundary and a component parallel to it. A system of equations governing these new unknowns then is con-structed. A damping term finally is introduced for the component orthogonal to the boundary. This layer model has the property of generating no reflection at the inter-face between the free medium and the artificial absorb-ing medium. In practice, both the boundary condition introduced at the outer boundary of the layer and the dis-persion resulting from the numerical scheme produce a small reflection which can be controlled even with very thin layers. As we will show with several experiments, this model gives very satisfactory results; namely, the re-flection coefficient, even in the case of heterogeneous, anisotropic media, is about 1{\%} for a layer thickness of five space discretization steps.},

abstract = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.},

@article{Komatitsch2007,
abstract = {The perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition has proven to be very efficient from a numerical point of view for the elastic wave equation to absorb both body waves with nongrazing incidence and surface waves. However, at grazing incidence the classical discrete PML method suffers from large spurious reflections that make it less efficient for instance in the case of very thin mesh slices, in the case of sources located close to the edge of the mesh, and/or in the case of receivers located at very large offset. We demonstrate how to improve the PML at grazing incidence for the differential seismic wave equation based on an unsplit convolution technique. The improved PML has a cost that is similar in terms of memory storage to that of the classical PML. We illustrate the efficiency of this improved convolutional PML based on numerical benchmarks using a finite-difference method on a thin mesh slice for an isotropic material and show that results are significantly improved compared with the...},

@article{Martin2009,
abstract = {P{\textgreater}In the context of the simulation of wave propagation, the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary layer has proven to be efficient to absorb non-grazing incidence waves. However, the classical discrete PML cannot efficiently absorb waves reaching the absorbing layer at grazing incidence. This is observed, for instance, in the case of thin mesh slices, or in the case of sources located close to the absorbing boundaries or receivers located at large offset. In order to improve the PML efficiency at grazing incidence we derive an unsplit convolutional PML (CPML) for a fourth-order staggered finite-difference numerical scheme applied to the 3-D viscoelastic seismic wave equation. The time marching equations of the standard linear solid mechanisms used do not need to be split and only the memory variables associated with velocity derivatives are stored at each time step. This is important in the case of more than one damping mechanism. Memory storage is reduced by more than 70 per cent in the PML regions in 3-D simulations compared to split PMLs optimized at grazing incidence. We validate the technique based on a benchmark performed in a thin mesh slice.},

abstract = {Among all the numerical methods in seismology, the finite-difference (FD) technique provides the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. This book offers a comprehensive introduction to FD and its applications to earthquake motion. Using a systematic tutorial approach, the book requires only undergraduate degree-level mathematics and provides a user-friendly explanation of the relevant theory. It explains FD schemes for solving wave equations and elastodynamic equations of motion in heterogeneous media, and provides an introduction to the rheology of viscoelastic and elastoplastic media. It also presents an advanced FD time-domain method for efficient numerical simulations of earthquake ground motion in realistic complex models of local surface sedimentary structures. Accompanied by a suite of online resources to help put the theory into practice, this is a vital resource for professionals and academic researchers using numerical seismological techniques, and graduate students in earthquake seismology, computational and numerical modelling, and applied mathematics.},

The CPML equations are expressed as the regular wave equations with additional correction terms, making the integration of the new condition into the existing seismic software relatively easy. Finally, effectiveness of the CPML is demonstrated on the example of a homogenous TTI model. For seismic imaging applications, it should be sufficient to use a 3 layer thick CPML.

This non-physical layer is used at the computational edge of a finite element method algorithm in frequency domain, and a pseudo-spectral algorithm in time domain, as an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to truncate unbounded media. Numerical results show that the C-PML ABC attenuates the outgoing surface waves more effectively than classical PML ABC as proposed by Berenger [J. Comput. Phys. 114, 195-200 (1994)] for electromagnetic waves in the case of oblique incidence, where the PML method suffers from large spurious reflections. Moreover, a modification of the proposed C-PML formulation is also discussed in order to stabilize the absorbing layer in anisotropic solids where numerical instabilities can appear.},
