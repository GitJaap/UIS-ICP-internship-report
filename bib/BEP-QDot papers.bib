abstract = {Electron transport experiments on two lateral quantum dots coupled in series$\backslash$nare reviewed. An introduction to the charge stability diagram is given in terms$\backslash$nof the electrochemical potentials of both dots. Resonant tunneling experiments$\backslash$nshow that the double dot geometry allows for an accurate determination of the$\backslash$nintrinsic lifetime of discrete energy states in quantum dots. The evolution of$\backslash$ndiscrete energy levels in magnetic field is studied. The resolution allows to$\backslash$nresolve avoided crossings in the spectrum of a quantum dot. With microwave$\backslash$nspectroscopy it is possible to probe the transition from ionic bonding (for$\backslash$nweak inter-dot tunnel coupling) to covalent bonding (for strong inter-dot$\backslash$ntunnel coupling) in a double dot artificial molecule. This review on the$\backslash$npresent experimental status of double quantum dot studies is motivated by their$\backslash$nrelevance for realizing solid state quantum bits.},

@article{Hanson2007,
abstract = {This review describes the physics of spins in quantum dots containing one or two electrons, from an experimentalist's viewpoint. Various methods for extracting spin properties from experiment are presented, restricted exclusively to electrical measurements. Furthermore, experimental techniques are discussed that allow for: (1) the rotation of an electron spin into a superposition of up and down, (2) the measurement of the quantum state of an individual spin and (3) the control of the interaction between two neighbouring spins by the Heisenberg exchange interaction. Finally, the physics of the relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms is reviewed and experimental results are compared with theories for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. All these subjects are directly relevant for the fields of quantum information processing and spintronics with single spins (i.e. single-spintronics).},
