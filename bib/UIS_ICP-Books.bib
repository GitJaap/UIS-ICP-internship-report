abstract = {We present a review of the recent development in finite-difference time-domain modeling of seismic wave propagation and earthquake motion. The finite-difference method is a robust numerical method applicable to structurally complex media. Due to its relative accuracy and computational efficiency it is the dominant method in modeling earthquake motion and it also is becoming increasingly more important in the seismic industry and for structural modeling. We first introduce basic formulations and properties of the finite-difference schemes including promising recent advances. Then we address important topics as material discontinuities, realistic attenuation, anisotropy, the planar free surface boundary condition, free-surface topography, wavefield excitation (including earthquake source dynamics), non-reflecting boundaries, and memory optimization and parallelization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the last 40 years geophysicists have found that it is possible to construct images and even determine important physical characteristics of rocks that can yield information about oil and gas bearing structures in the earth. To make these images and extract this information requires the application of an advanced understanding of the mathematical physics of wave propagation. The oil and gas industry labels a major collection of the necessary seismic data processing methods by the name seismic "migration". This text ist the first to treat many kinds of migration in a unified mahtematical way. The audience is mathematically oriented geophysicists or applied mathematicians working in the field of "inverse scattering imaging". The text can serve as a bridge between the applied math and geophysics community by presenting geophysicists with a practical introduction to advanced engineering mathematics, while presenting mathematicians with a window into the world of the mathematically sophistiated geophysicist.},
