abstract = {This article revisits the classical problem of horizontal and vertical point loads suddenly applied onto the surface of a homogeneous, elastic half-space, and provides a complete set of exact, explicit formulae which are cast in the most compact format and with the simplest possible structure. The formulae given are valid for the full range of Poisson's ratios from 0 to 0.5, and they treat real and complex poles alike, as a result of which a single set of formulae suffices and also exact formulae for dipoles can be given.},

@article{Sanchez-Sesma2006,
abstract = {The exact analytical solution for surface displacements due to a volu- metric line source disturbance buried in an elastic homogeneous and isotropic half- space is attributable to W. W. Garvin. These results are in the time domain but the final expressions are only valid for a step-time variation of the load. We give a summary of Garvin's work and extend it for virtually any given time signal. By analytical and numerical integration of the exact analytical solution we implicitly consider a ramp source function (this simple mathematical trick allows for regular waveforms). This solution can be used as a practical tool to test numerical techniques. Some examples are presented, and synthetic seismograms and polarigrams are dis- played.},
