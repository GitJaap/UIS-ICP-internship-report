abstract = {This review describes the physics of spins in quantum dots containing one or two electrons, from an experimentalist's viewpoint. Various methods for extracting spin properties from experiment are presented, restricted exclusively to electrical measurements. Furthermore, experimental techniques are discussed that allow for: (1) the rotation of an electron spin into a superposition of up and down, (2) the measurement of the quantum state of an individual spin and (3) the control of the interaction between two neighbouring spins by the Heisenberg exchange interaction. Finally, the physics of the relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms is reviewed and experimental results are compared with theories for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. All these subjects are directly relevant for the fields of quantum information processing and spintronics with single spins (i.e. single-spintronics).},

abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f{\&}isin;C{\textless}sup{\textgreater}N{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and a randomly chosen set of frequencies {\&}Omega;. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set {\&}Omega;? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)={\&}sigma;{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\&}tau;{\&}isin;T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}f({\&}tau;){\&}delta;(t-{\&}tau;) obeying |T|{\&}le;C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}M{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\&}middot;(log N){\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} {\&}middot; |{\&}Omega;| for some constant C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}M{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textgreater}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-M{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the {\&}{\#}8467;{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}M{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(|T|{\&}middot;logN). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-M{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to |T|{\&}middot;logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

abstract = {Nonrigid registration of medical images is important for a number of applications such as the creation of population averages, atlas-based segmentation, or geometric correction of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images to name a few. In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to solve this problem, one class of which involves maximizing a mutual information (MI)-based objective function over a regular grid of splines. This approach has produced good results but its computational complexity is proportional to the compliance of the transformation required to register the smallest structures in the image. Here, we propose a method that permits the spatial adaptation of the transformation's compliance. This spatial adaptation allows us to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the overall transformation, thus speeding up the process and improving its convergence properties. To develop this method, we introduce several novelties: 1) we rely on radially symmetric basis functions rather than B-splines traditionally used to model the deformation field; 2) we propose a metric to identify regions that are poorly registered and over which the transformation needs to be improved; 3) we partition the global registration problem into several smaller ones; and 4) we introduce a new constraint scheme that allows us to produce transformations that are topologically correct. We compare the approach we propose to more traditional ones and show that our new algorithm compares favorably to those in current use.},

abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0{\textless}ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

abstract = {We have used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscope to image individual vortices near lithographically patterned surface steps in weak-pinning superconducting thin films of amorphous MoGe. The field-cooled vortex distributions are strongly influenced by the surface steps, with an enhanced vortex density along the thin side of the steps and a wide vortex- free region along the thick side of the steps. The surface steps induce orientational order that persists for many intervortex spacings away from the steps. We study the effects of surface step pinning for different magnetic- field strengths and step heights by analyzing the intervortex spacing and computing vortex correlation functions. For certain sample configurations, we are able to apply a Lorentz force to the vortices and observe an asymmetric vortex response near the surface steps. We discuss the interaction between a vortex and a surface step and consider possible mechanisms for generating the vortex distributions which we observe upon field cooling},

abstract = {Microwave resonators fabricated from superconducting thin films are play- ing a critical role with recent advances in superconducting quantum com- puting technology and photon detectors. There has been an intensive worldwide effort to study the sources of loss that limit the quality factors of these resonators. In this thesis, I have focused on the measurements of the microwave response of vortices in Al and Re superconducting thin film resonators cooled in magnetic fields comparable to or less than that of the Earth. Previous work on vortex dynamics at microwave frequencies has involved large magnetic fields, orders of magnitude larger than the Earth's field. Al and Re are common materials used in superconducting resonant circuits for qubits and detectors. Despite the similarities of Al and Re superconductors, the microwave vortex response is strikingly dif- ferent in the two materials from my resonator measurements. I present a quantitative model for the dissipation and reactance contributed by the vortices in terms of the elastic pinning forces and the viscous damping from the vortex cores. The differences in the vortex response in Al and Re were due to the vortex pinning strength in the two films. The critical role played by pinning in determining the microwave response motivated us to try to modify the pinning in our Al films by nanostruc- turing the film surface. A single narrow slot along the centerline of a resonator was used to increase the pinning in the resonator traces and resulted in a reduction of the loss from vortices by over an order of mag- nitude. Such patterned pinning techniques could be used on resonators in systems with insufficient shielding or pulsed control fields to reduce the loss from unwanted trapped vortices. Finally, we explored the possibility for using measurements of the power dependence of the resonators to determine if trapped vortices are present.},

abstract = {Computational simulations of multiphase Row are challenging because many practical applications require adequate resolution of not only interfacial physics associated with moving boundaries with possible topological changes, but also around three-dimensional, irregular solid geometries. In this paper, we highlight recent efforts made in simulating multiphase fluid dynamics around complex geometries, based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. The approach uses two independent but related grid layouts to track the interfacial and solid boundary conditions, and is capable of capturing interfacial as well as multiphase dynamics. In particular, the stationary Cartesian grid with time dependent, local adaptive refinement is utilized to handle the computation of the transport equations, while the interface shape and movement are treated by marker-based triangulated surface meshes which freely move and interact with the Cartesian grid. The markers are also used to identify the location of solid boundaries and enforce the no-slip condition there. Issues related to the contact line treatment, topological changes of multiphase fronts during merger or breakup of objects, and necessary data structures and solution techniques are also highlighted. Selected test cases including spacecraft fuel tank flow management and liquid plug flow dynamics are presented.},

abstract = {The Six Degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) is a spectroscopic survey of the southern sky, which aims to provide positions and velocities of galaxies in the nearby Universe. We present here the adaptive tiling algorithm developed to place 6dFGS fields on the sky, and allocate targets to those fields. Optimal solutions to survey field placement are generally extremely difficult to find, especially in this era of large-scale galaxy surveys, as the space of available solutions is vast (2N dimensional) and false optimal solutions abound. The 6dFGS algorithm utilises the Metropolis (simulated annealing) method to overcome this problem. By design the algorithm gives uniform completeness independent of local density, so as to result in a highly complete and uniform observed sample. The adaptive tiling achieves a sampling rate of approximately 95{\%}, a variation in the sampling uniformity of less than 5{\%}, and an efficiency in terms of used fibres per field of greater than 90{\%}. We have tested whether the tiling algorithm systematically biases the large-scale structure in the survey by studying the two-point correlation function of mock 6dF volumes. Our analysis shows that the constraints on fibre proximity with 6dF lead to under-estimating galaxy clustering on small scales ({\textless} 1 Mpc) by up to {\~{}}20{\%}, but that the tiling introduces no significant sampling bias at larger scales.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human faces from frontal views with varying expression and illumination, as well as occlusion and disguise. We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by l{\{}1{\}}-minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as Eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.},

abstract = {"Extended Ensemble Monte Carlo" is a generic term that indicates a set of algorithms, which are now popular in a variety of fields in physics and statistical information processing. Exchange Monte Carlo (Metropolis-Coupled Chain, Parallel Tempering), Simulated Tempering (Expanded Ensemble Monte Carlo) and Multicanonical Monte Carlo (Adaptive Umbrella Sampling) axe typical members of this family. Here, we give a cross-disciplinary survey of these algorithms with special emphasis on the great flexibility of the underlying idea. In Sec. 2, we discuss the background of Extended Ensemble Monte Carlo. In Sees. 3, 4 and 5, three types of the algorithms, i.e., Exchange Monte Carlo, Simulated Tempering, Multicanonical Monte Carlo, are introduced. In Sec. 6, we give an introduction to Replica Monte Carlo algorithm by Swendsen and Wang. Strategies for the construction of special-purpose extended ensembles are discussed in Sec. 7. We stress that an extension is not necessary restricted to the space of energy or temperature. Even unphysical (unrealizable) configurations can be included in the ensemble, if the resultant fast mixing of the Markov chain offsets the increasing cost of the sampling procedure. Multivariate (multicomponent) extensions are also useful in many examples. In Sec. 8, we give a survey on extended ensembles with a state space whose dimensionality is dynamically varying. In the appendix, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of three types of extended ensemble algorithms.},

These techniques improve the performance of dynamic imaging significantly across multiple clinical applications, including cardiac functional examinations, perfusion imaging, blood flow assessment, contrast-enhanced angiography, functional MRI, and interventional imaging, among others. The scan acceleration permits higher spatial resolution, increased temporal resolution, shorter scan duration, or a combination of these benefits. Along with the exciting developments is a dizzying proliferation of acronyms and variations of the techniques. The present review attempts to summarize this rapidly growing topic and presents conceptual frameworks to understand these techniques in terms of their underlying mechanics and connections.

abstract = {The controlled growth of nanowires (NWs) with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelengths of the charge carriers allows fundamental investigations of quantum confinement phenomena. Here, we present studies of proximity-induced superconductivity in undoped Ge/Si core/shell NW heterostructures contacted by superconducting leads. By using a top gate electrode to modulate the carrier density in the NW, the critical supercurrent can be tuned from zero to greater than 100 nA. Furthermore, discrete sub-bands form in the NW due to confinement in the radial direction, which results in stepwise increases in the critical current as a function of gate voltage. Transport measurements on these superconductor-NW-superconductor devices reveal high-order (n = 25) resonant multiple Andreev reflections, indicating that the NW channel is smooth and the charge transport is highly coherent. The ability to create and control coherent superconducting ordered states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid nanostructures allows for new opportunities in the study of fundamental low-dimensional superconductivity.},

We show that the energy spectra of the Andreev bound states at the junction are qualitatively different in topologically trivial (i.e., not containing any Majorana) and nontrivial phases having an even and odd number of crossings at zero energy, respectively. The measurement of the supercurrent through the junction allows one to discern topologically distinct phases and observe a topological phase transition by simply changing the in-plane magnetic field or the gate voltage. The observation of this phase transition will be a direct demonstration of the existence of Majorana particles.},

abstract = {Combined EEG/fMRI recording has been used to localize the generators of EEG events and to identify subject state in cognitive studies and is of increasing interest. However, the large EEG artifacts induced during fMRI have precluded simultaneous EEG and fMRI recording, restricting study design. Removing this artifact is difficult, as it normally exceeds EEG significantly and contains components in the EEG frequency range. We have developed a recording system and an artifact reduction method that reduce this artifact effectively. The recording system has large dynamic range to capture both low-amplitude EEG and large imaging artifact without distortion (resolution 2 microV, range 33.3 mV), 5-kHz sampling, and low-pass filtering prior to the main gain stage. Imaging artifact is reduced by subtracting an averaged artifact waveform, followed by adaptive noise cancellation to reduce any residual artifact. This method was validated in recordings from five subjects using periodic and continuous fMRI sequences. Spectral analysis revealed differences of only 10 to 18{\%} between EEG recorded in the scanner without fMRI and the corrected EEG. Ninety-nine percent of spike waves (median 74 microV) added to the recordings were identified in the corrected EEG compared to 12{\%} in the uncorrected EEG. The median noise after artifact reduction was 8 microV. All these measures indicate that most of the artifact was removed, with minimal EEG distortion. Using this recording system and artifact reduction method, we have demonstrated that simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies are for the first time possible, extending the scope of EEG/fMRI studies considerably.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {In some applications of adaptive filtering such as active noise reduction, and network and acoustic echo cancellation, the adaptive filter may be required to have a large number of coefficients in order to model the unknown physical medium with sufficient accuracy. The computational complexity of adaptation algorithms is proportional to the number of filter coefficients. This implies that, for long adaptive filters, the adaptation task can become prohibitively expensive, ruling out cost-effective implementation on digital signal processors. The purpose of partial coefficient updates is to reduce the computational complexity of an adaptive filter by adapting a block of the filter coefficients rather than the entire filter at every iteration. In this paper, we develop a selective-partial-update normalized least-mean-square (NI,MS) algorithm, and analyze its stability using the traditional independence assumptions and error-energy bounds. Selective partial updating is also extended to the affine projection (AP) algorithm by introducing multiple constraints. The new algorithms appear to have good convergence performance as attested to by computer simulations with real speech signals.},

We first discuss in some detail the simplest 'toy model' in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than 10 years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin–orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics. The text should be accessible for readers with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and second quantization, and does not require knowledge of quantum field theory or topological states of matter.},

abstract = {Motion of electrons can influence their spins through a fundamental effect called spin-orbit interaction. This interaction provides a way to control spins electrically and thus lies at the foundation of spintronics. Even at the level of single electrons, the spin-orbit interaction has proven promising for coherent spin rotations. Here we implement a spin-orbit quantum bit (qubit) in an indium arsenide nanowire, where the spin-orbit interaction is so strong that spin and motion can no longer be separated. In this regime, we realize fast qubit rotations and universal single-qubit control using only electric fields; the qubits are hosted in single-electron quantum dots that are individually addressable. We enhance coherence by dynamically decoupling the qubits from the environment. Nanowires offer various advantages for quantum computing: they can serve as one-dimensional templates for scalable qubit registers, and it is possible to vary the material even during wire growth. Such flexibility can be used to design wires with suppressed decoherence and to push semiconductor qubit fidelities towards error correction levels. Furthermore, electrical dots can be integrated with optical dots in p-n junction nanowires. The coherence times achieved here are sufficient for the conversion of an electronic qubit into a photon, which can serve as a flying qubit for long-distance quantum communication.},

abstract = {An adaptive distributed strategy is developed based on incremental techniques. The proposed scheme addresses the problem of linear estimation in a cooperative fashion, in which nodes equipped with local computing abilities derive local estimates and share them with their predefined neighbors. The resulting algorithm is distributed, cooperative, and able to respond in real time to changes in the environment. Each node is allowed to communicate with its immediate neighbor in order to exploit the spatial dimension while limiting the communications burden at the same time. A spatial-temporal energy conservation argument is used to evaluate the steady-state performance of the individual nodes across the entire network. Computer simulations illustrate the results.},

@article{Saksono2007,
abstract = {The primary objective of this work is to extend the capability of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)based strategy for solving fluid-structure interaction problems. This is driven by the fact that the ALE mesh movement techniques will not be able to treat problems in which fluid-structure interface experiences large motion. In addition, for certain problems the need arises to capture accurately flow features, such as a region with high gradients of the solution variables. This can be achieved by incorporating an adaptive refreshing procedure into the solution strategy.
As in our previous works (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 2006; 195:1633-1666; Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 12006; 195:5754-5779), here, the fluid flow is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and modelled by using stabilized low order velocity-pres sure finite elements. The motion of the fluid domain is accounted for by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The flexible structure is represented by means of appropriate standard finite element formulations while the motion of the rigid body is described by rigid body dynamics. For temporal discretization of both fluid and solid bodies, the discrete implicit generalized-g method is employed. The resulting strongly coupled set of non-linear equations is then solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton-Raphson methodology and incorporates full linearization of the overall incremental problem.
Within the adaptive solution strategy, the quality of fluid mesh and the solution quality indicator are evaluated regularly and compared against the appropriate remeshing criteria to decide whether a remeshing step is required. The adaptive remeshing procedure follows closely the standard computational procedure in which the adaptive remeshing process produces a mesh that can capture salient features of the flow field. For the problems under consideration in this work the motion of the fluid boundary very often results in boundaries with very high curvatures and a fluid domain that contain areas with small cross-sections. To be able to generate meshes that give result with acceptable accuracy these local geometrical features need to be included in determining the element density distribution. The numerical examples demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Almeida2000,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present the results on finite element adaptive strategies for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems with singularities arising from shock phenomena and/or discontinuous boundary data. The adaptive analysis is based on an optimal-mesh-adaptive strategy which is employed to refine the mesh, stretch and orient the elements in such a way that, along the adaptation process, the mesh becomes aligned with the discontinuities. This mesh adaptation process yields improved results in locating regions of rapid or abrupt variations of the variables, whose location is not known a priori. On the other hand, the proposed mesh adaptation process is generated by minimizing, for a given number of elements in the mesh, a new anisotropic error estimator based on local directional interpolation error and recovering of the second derivatives of the finite element solution. Several adaptive mesh-refinement solutions for interpolation problems are presented in order to show that the proposed optimal adaptive strategy using this anisotropic error estimator recovers optimal and/or superconvergent rates. Finally, applications of this approach to CFD problems are also presented in order to show the computational performance of the proposed optimal adaptive procedure.},

@article{Brouwer2012,
abstract = {All known fundamental particles are either bosons or fermions. Fermions are subject to the Pauli principle, which forbids two particles being in the same quantum state; bosons, by contrast, tend to bunch together in the same state. The same rule applies to the excitations of most solid-state systems, such as metals and semiconductors, which can be classified as fermionic or bosonic. However, sometimes excitations—quasiparticles—of a fundamentally different type emerge that resemble particles that hitherto have been considered only as a mathematical possibility. On page 1003 of this issue, Mourik et al. (1) report on a superconducting nanostructure that harbors such an exotic quasiparticle, a “Majorana bound state,” an excitation that can best be described as half a fermion. The Majorana bound state is named after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana, who proposed an equation describing a fermionic particle with a real-valued wave function (2). In contrast to the standard (Dirac) fermion, which has a complex wave function, a particle with a real-valued wave function is equal to its own antiparticle. No fundamental particles are known to be Majorana fermions, although there are speculations that the neutrino is one (3). The reported bound state is a localized version of Majorana's fermion.},

@article{Mahoney2011,
abstract = {Randomized algorithms for very large matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Much of this work was motivated by problems in large-scale data analysis. Although this work had its origins within theoretical computer science, where researchers were interested in proving worst-case bounds, i.e., bounds without any assumptions at all on the input data, researchers from numerical linear algebra, statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning, as well as domain scientists have subsequently extended and applied these methods in important ways. Although this has been great for the development of the area and for the technology transfer of theoretical ideas into practical applications, this interdisciplinarity has thus far sometimes obscured the underlying simplicity and generality of the core ideas.   This review will provide a detailed overview of recent work on randomized algorithms for matrix problems, with an emphasis on a few simple core ideas that underlie not only recent theoretical advances but also the usefulness of these tools in large-scale data applications. Crucial in this context is the connection with concept of statistical leverage. This concept has long been used in statistical regression diagnostics to identify outliers; and it has recently proved crucial in the development of improved worst-case matrix algorithms that are also amenable to high-quality numerical implementation and that are useful to domain scientists. This connection arises naturally when one explicitly decouples the effect of randomization in these matrix algorithms from the underlying linear algebraic structure. This decoupling also permits much finer control in the application of randomization, as well as the easier exploitation of domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Majorana fermions hold promise for quantum computation, because their non-Abelian braiding statistics allows for topologically protected operations on quantum information. Topological qubits can be constructed from pairs of well-separated Majoranas in networks of nanowires. The coupling to a superconducting charge qubit in a transmission line resonator (transmon) permits braiding of Majoranas by external variation of magnetic fluxes. We show that readout operations can also be fully flux-controlled, without requiring microscopic control over tunnel couplings. We identify the minimal circuit that can perform the initialization–braiding–measurement steps required to demon- strate non-Abelian statistics. We introduce the Random Access MajoranaMemory, a scalable circuit that can perform a joint parity measurement on Majoranas belonging to a selection of topological qubits. Such multi-qubit measurements allow for the efficient creation of highly entangled states and simplify quantum error correction protocols by avoiding the need for ancilla qubits. After},

Journal of Chemical Physics, 1953;21(6): 1087-1092). In the proposed methodology, samples are simulated as the states of a Markov chain and are distributed asymptotically according to the optimal importance sampling density. A kernel sampling density is then constructed from these samples which is used as the sampling density in an importance sampling simulation. The Markov chain samples populate the region of higher probability density in the failure region and so the kernel sampling density approximates the optimal importance sampling density for a large variety of shapes of the failure region. This adaptive feature is insensitive to the probability level to be estimated.
